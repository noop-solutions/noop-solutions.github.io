        <p class="fs-6">
        We started from a desire to provide better campus recreation software. As students, we were frustrated by our campus intramural software taking a long time to be updated and once we found out that behind the scenes it was not a real-time process we knew the scene was set for providing a better solution. From there a few years of research and planning culminated with our alma mater beta testing the solution for a year. They chose to purchase the software and it has continued to evolve into what it is today.

        We couldn't stop there so we created a physical plant solution for tracking work orders, labor, parts, and purchasing. Since then we have also partnered with a school in Asia to provide a custom Student Information System (SIS).
